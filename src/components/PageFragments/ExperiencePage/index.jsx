                    Managing the chargeback of merchants and collecting the valid documents to fight the chargeback raised by the cardholder. The merchants are registered in the application along with their details to fight, prevent and recover the chargebacks. Providing all the evidence of purchase by the cardholder and putting it in the required format and template for the payment processor was the core of this project. Based on the collected data and success or failure of chargeback processing the reports get generated and shown to the client. Also the software is used to suggest improvements to reduce chargeback to the merchants.

                    Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) is revolutionary in the cable industry. Consequently it provides cable operators visibility and actionable insight which enables them to more efficiently identify and repair plant and in-home and or outside plant impairments on a user-friendly interface easily understood by technicians using GIS technology. Proactive Network Maintenance is an application that uses DOCSIS pre-equalization to proactively identify hybrid fiber coax (HFC) RF plant impairments more efficiently and cost effectively rather than traditional test equipment.

                    The project is to migrate the data from the legacy system to the existing PLM database. The data from the legacy system is available in MS Excel file format and the data loader adapters are used to read this file and load the data in the PLM database. While loading the data, the unload data scripts are also generated so that failure cases can be handled to reload the data. The temporary database is also used to store some data, which can be used for further processing after data load. The adapters connect to the Oracle database to store the data. Data mining is performed after data loading. Data mining can be achieved using application customization. Data is loaded from 6 different legacy systems.

This integration is used in various organizations where MSOffice tools are used. The office applications interact with the applet on the client machine and the applet interacts with the servlet on the server to transfer the data from client machine to the matrix software. Data on the server is processed by the server component and saved in the PLM Oracle database.

This was achieved by writing Unix scripts to change all the java and jsp files and also some include files. Because of the scripts the development time was reduced drastically and the team could get more time for unit testing and system testing. The project was delivered on time.
