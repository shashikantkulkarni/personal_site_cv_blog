                    The project is to migrate the data from legacy system to
                    exsiting PLM database. The data from legacy system is
                    available in MS Excel file format and the data loader
                    adapters are used to read this file and load the data in PLM
                    database. While loading the data, the unload data scripts
                    are also generated so that failure cases can be handeled to
                    reload the data. The temporary database is also used to
                    store some data, which can be used for further processing
                    after data load. The adapters connect to Oracle database to
                    store the data. Data mining is performed after data loading.
                    Data mining can be achieved using application customization.
                    Data is loaded from 6 different legacy systems.

                  <p>
                    A document storage utility is developed for storing the
                    project related important documents and mails in one common
                    repository. One daemon was written in VB, as a windows
                    service, which runs as a background process, for reading the
                    mails and to convert them in HTML files. This tool also
                    helped in keeping the project related documents, especially
                    mails in one location so that all the team members can
                    access those mails anytime and know what is the current
                    status.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Technologies used are ASP, VBScript, VB, HTML, IIS, MS-SQL
                  </p>
