Wow!!! Finally I have started writing my own blog on my own domain. It feels nice. I will start with one of my most happiest moments of life which is passing Oracle Certified Master, Java EE 5 Enterprise Architect certification(OCMJEA), previously known as Sun Certified Enterprise Architect (SCEA).

On Dec 08 2011, I received the most awaited email from Oracle.

Hi Shashikant,
Congratulations! You have passed the Oracle Certified Master, Java EE 5 Enterprise Architect certification. You are among the elite 1% of certified Java professionals who have gone on to achieve the Java Enterprise Architect certification.

I was reading the email again and again, just to make sure that I am not in dream but then I realized that it was reality. After waiting for almost 10 weeks I was very excited. It is one of the most happiest moments of life. Finally the efforts paid through. I spent many sleepless nights in preparing for this certification for a reason that Oracle was introducing the mandatory course from Oct 01 2011 and I wanted to clear the certification before that. I got very less time for preparation due to office work load and having 2 children who are very demanding.

Here are my details

Part I: August 27, 2011 Score 85%
Part II: Sept 22, 2011 Score 149/160 (Assignment: Big Smokes Cigar Shop)
Part III: Sept 27, 2011
I have met all the requirements in this accreditation track and has joined the elite group of Oracle Certified Professionals who have demonstrated a commitment to excellence using Oracle’s leading technologies. This certification is one of its kind in the world of Java and J2EE for Architects and aspiring Architects. This certifica-tion tests one’s skills in objective based questions and an Assignment to design a software system by giving problem statements.

Thanks to my wife and my 2 children for constanly supporting me. Thanks to my 2 special colleagues who helped me in reviewing my assignment and giving me feedback.

I have shared my experience of achieving this certification in my next blog
