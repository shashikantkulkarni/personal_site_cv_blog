excerpt: Blogging and writing about tech stacks is always been my thing. I will start with one of my most happiest moments of life which is passing Oracle Certified Master, Java EE 5 Enterprise Architect certification(OCMJEA), previously known as Sun Certified Enterprise Architect (SCEA).

I attempted the SCEA-part1 exam on Aug 27, 2011 and passed with 83% score.

I referred:
Sun Certified Enterprise Architect for Java™ EE Study Guide by Mark Cade and Humphrey Sheil
Head First Design Patterns
Head First EJB
J2EE tutorial
Mikalai tutorial
Some tutorials on javaworld
Sun’s ePractice and whizlabs SCEA5 exam simulator.

I had started preparing for this exam in Mar-2011. I was not getting time to prepare as my new project was just started. I had to travel to Germany for understanding the project details. In Jun-2011 I came to know about the training dates being pushed to Oct-01, 2011. I was glad and then I started in full swing. I wanted to clear all the three parts of the certification as early as possible.

I have good experitse and interest in Object oriented analysis and design. I previously did Sun Certified Java Programmer certification.

But the expectations of OCMJEA (SCEA) are different. Part 1 is multiple choice questions with 64 questions in all. Candidate has to get passing marks of 57% to pass the part1. Each question can have more than one correct answer but they do specify how many answers are correct. One get the marks only when he/she has provided all the correct answers otherwise nothing.

It’s a tough exam with a lot of scenario based questions. It tests your real knowledge and your experience. Questions are quite lengthy and the candidate has to develop fast reading practice. The question contains some hints to reject one/two wrong choices. But do read the questions carefully as SCEA5 is really a tough one. Generally conceptual questions will be asked and no syntax based questions. Candidate must organize time really well. Try to cover all the topics and don’t leave anything. One can mark the questions for review to come back later.

I got 45 minutes after finishing the questions and then i reviewed all the questions marked for reviews.

Some of the questions and their answers are very much confusing . Take a good sleep before the exam as it requires very good focus during the exam time. Most of the questions you can answer are based on your past experience and whatever you read during preparation. Rest you need to very much mentally present to figure out the correct answers.

A lot of thanks to Javaranch members in SCEA5 forum. It’s very valuable website and most of the updates, strategies are being discussed out there. Following two sites helped me a lot for clearing my doubts.

I will say it’s not the certification but what all we have learned during the preparation that matters.

In terms of overall preparation for part1 – it took around 2 to 3 months for me with the average weekly effort of around 8-10 hours.
