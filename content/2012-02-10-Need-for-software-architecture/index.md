A successful architecture forms the platform for strategic advantage. On the contrary if there is lack of architecture then the projects ends up in bad shape sometime in near future.

To make best use of legacy systems which sometimes are hard to replace, architecture helps to bridge it with new software and environment.

Architecture is the essential foundation for agility, responsiveness and effectiveness. Architecture addresses complexity, reliability, scalability and other quality attributes (non-functional requirements).

Architecture serves both technical and organizational purposes. On the organizational side, the architecture helps in:

- **_Communicating the high-level design_** to all the involved stakeholders need to understand the system at a fairly gross level. The reduction in detail makes it easier to grasp the assignment. Moreover, it satisfies the constraint that has important implications.

- **_Providing the system context_** to the developers who need to understand the system at higher lever to develop the components in effective manner.

- Architecture also help in **_decomposing_** the system in smaller, manageable **_work components_** with give constraints, assumptions and limitations

On the technical side, architecture allows us to design better systems:

- **_Meet system requirements and objectives_**, both functional and non-functional requirements. Architecture allows us to evaluate and make tradeoffs among requirements of differing priority.

- Architecture also helps in **_separating the responsibilities_** of components. This results in flexible and maintainable code. This requires careful attention to the distribution of components early in the architectural design process.

- **_Reduce cost of maintenance and evolution_**:

  - By identifying the potential risks
  - By anticipating possible changes.

- Architecture enables **_reusability_** of components and frameworks.

To convince the importance of the architecture to senior management, architecture should be mapped with the business goal and vision.
