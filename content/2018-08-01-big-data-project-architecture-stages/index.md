Here are the high level stages in architecting the big data projects. This is a template. You can refer it as a guideline but this is not a rule. Based on your project requirement you may or may not need some stages, which is possible. To come up with solution of your big data project you can refer this template as a guideline. I prepared it based on my experience in architecting and designing the big data project I worked on.

Hope this is helpful
